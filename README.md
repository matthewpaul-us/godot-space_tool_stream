# godot-space_tool_stream
Basic prototype of a 3-burst laser gun for the Sci-fi Game Design mini-challenge. This challenge was completed on 2020-08-14.

The basic design was a laser gun that can shoot 3 lasers with one pull, but has to manage heat.

The gun's heat is in the upper left corner. Shoot too fast and it will overheat, which means you have to wait until the heat dissipates.

You can find a playable demo on the project's itch.io page here: https://mpaul0416.itch.io/side-quest-stream-project-laser-gun.

# Challenge
Hello @everyone! The theme for this week's mini challenges is :ringed_planet: Science Fiction :ringed_planet:  and todayâ€™s challenge will see your design meddle tested!

-----------------------------------------------------------------
:star: Mini Challenge Number 4 with @Gilbrilthor :star: 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

You've been asked to help colonize a new planet! :globe_with_meridians: For today's challenge, you will design either a tool or a weapon to assist colonists on the planet they will be sent to.

TODAY'S CHALLENGE

Design and then implement a tool or weapon that would be useful for colonists on a new world. Even if you can't program, design a tool that you think would be great to have. There might be a programmer (me) who's struggling for an idea.

1. Start with a design of how the tool works. Think of what obstacles the colonists may face on the planet. Do they need help with food and shelter, or is defense a priority? This can be a drawing, a description, or some mechanics about how the tool operates. If you aren't going to program it, go ahead and post to #mini-challenges and see what everyone else is doing.

2. Build up a prototype to test your design out. It could be side-scrolling or top-down, 2D or 3D -- just enough to test your tool. I'm planning on using the assets from http://adamatomic.com/bomberplanet/assets.html.

3. Program your tool design. It doesn't have to be perfect (no initial testing is). Can you show the colonists something they would be excited about? Post either a short video or an itch page with your demo for all of us!

You have until 23:59 EST/03:59 GMT/04:59 BST to complete your challenge. Share your progress in the #mini-challenges channel.

Also, I will be streaming design and programming from 12:00 EST/16:00 GMT/17:00 BST. The stream will last about an hour and a half. I have no idea what I will be making, but drop in and have a chat, see progress, ask questions, whatever. Good Luck!
