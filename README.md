Basic prototype of a 3-burst laser gun for the Sci-fi Game Design mini-challenge. This challenge was completed on 2020-08-14.

The basic design was a laser gun that can shoot 3 lasers with one pull, but has to manage heat.

The gun's heat is in the upper left corner. Shoot too fast and it will overheat, which means you have to wait until the heat dissipates.
